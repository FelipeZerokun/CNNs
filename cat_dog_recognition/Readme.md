# CAT-DOG RECOGNITION MODEL

## CNN model for image recognition

Here I created a CNN model from scrath that will distinct between a dog or a cat in a image.

I used a 10000 images dataset split evenly between dogs and cats images. For the training set I used 8000 images, and for the validation set I used 2000 images.

Still needs a lot of improvements, and since the preprocessing module of Tensorflow is deprecated, I will find a new way to preprocess the images.
